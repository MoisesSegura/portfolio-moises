I am an Information Technology professional with hands-on experience in designing, developing, and maintaining web applications, primarily using PHP (Laravel), MySQL, and modern frontend technologies such as React and Vue.

Beyond my technical background, I bring strong analytical skills in requirements gathering, process modeling, and cross-functional communication—allowing me to bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders.

I’m known for being proactive, adaptable, and highly committed to continuous learning. I’m currently seeking opportunities where I can grow in hybrid roles that combine both technical development and business analysis—particularly as a Technical Business Analyst.
